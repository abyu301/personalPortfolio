> Real-world development means working with existing code, improving it, and deploying it to production — this project does exactly that.

---

## 👋 Overview
This portfolio represents my **real-world web development journey**.  
Instead of only building projects from scratch, I focused on **working with existing (legacy) code**, improving it, fixing issues, and deploying a **live, production-ready website**.

This reflects how development work happens in real companies.

Through this project, I demonstrate my ability to:
- Understand unfamiliar codebases
- Clean and refactor existing files
- Customize features based on real needs
- Deploy websites using real hosting environments

---

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates
- Working with **existing / legacy code**
- Frontend development with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- Backend integration using **PHP** (contact form)
- Debugging layout and functionality issues
- Version control with **Git & GitHub**
- Website deployment using **FTP, DNS, and hosting**
- Experience with a **production environment**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** PHP (contact / messaging functionality)  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub  
- **Hosting:** Hostinger  
- **Deployment:** FTP (Cyberduck)  
- **Domain & DNS:** Custom domain with DNS configuration  

---

## 🔄 My Real Development Workflow
1. Purchased a professional template (Envato)
2. Analyzed the existing project structure
3. Removed unused files and unnecessary assets
4. Customized layout, content, and design
5. Fixed bugs and improved responsiveness
6. Tracked changes using Git & GitHub
7. Tested locally
8. Deployed to a live production server

---

## 🌍 Deployment Process (Production)
I personally handled the full deployment process:

1. Rented a server (Hostinger)
2. Purchased a custom domain
3. Connected the domain using DNS
4. Created an FTP user (username & password)
5. Retrieved the server IP
6. Connected using Cyberduck
7. Uploaded cleaned project files
8. Website went live 🎉

## 🧩 Challenges, Solutions & What I Learned

### 1️⃣ Understanding an Existing Codebase
**Challenge:**  
The project contained many files written by another developer, which was difficult to understand at first.

**Solution:**  
- Carefully reviewed the folder structure
- Read HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files line by line
- Identified which files were actually used
- Removed unnecessary files to simplify the project

**What I Learned:**  
How to quickly understand and work with unfamiliar code — a critical real-world skill.

---

### 2️⃣ Customizing Design Without Breaking the Layout
**Challenge:**  
While updating the design (including banners created in Canva), some layout and responsiveness issues appeared.

**Solution:**  
- Used browser DevTools to inspect CSS conflicts
- Refactored CSS instead of overriding blindly
- Tested the website on different screen sizes

**What I Learned:**  
Small CSS changes can affect the entire layout, and careful testing is essential.

---

### 3️⃣ PHP Contact Form (First Backend Experience)
**Challenge:**  
This was my first time working with PHP, and the contact form did not work correctly on the live server.

**Solution:**  
- Used documentation and AI assistance to understand PHP logic
- Fixed file paths and server permission issues
- Tested the form after deployment

**What I Learned:**  
Frontend development often requires backend and server-side understanding.

---

### 4️⃣ Domain, DNS & Deployment Issues
**Challenge:**  
Connecting the domain, DNS, and server correctly without errors.

**Solution:**  
- Configured DNS records properly
- Verified server IP and domain propagation
- Used FTP securely to deploy production files

**What I Learned:**  
How real hosting environments work beyond local development.
